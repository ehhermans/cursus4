# Tips

### Thomas

-   You and i both need to sometimes be less on our own when we are working and more group based

### Maarten

-   You can definitely let your voice get heard more from time to time.
-   Also, if your gonna be late and joining us later, keep making sure to properly communicate that.

### Jochem

### Levi

-   I feel like sometimes you get a bit stuck on your own idea's and interpretations and overriding what we decide as a group in that
-   Make sure to keep up with the tasks you've been assigned, including giving others feedback

# Tops

### Thomas

-   You have a really unique and different idea/view on things then most of us which is a refreshing perspective.

### Maarten

-   You're very cool, calm, collected and it's nice to work together with that energy.

### Jochem

### Levi

-   The things you make are 10/10, they look good, are well thought through and seem to have a lot of dedication put into them
