### Maarten
- You can definitely let your voice get heard more from time to time. 
- Also, if your gonna be late and joining us later, keep making sure to properly communicate that.
### Jochem
### Levi
- I feel like sometimes you get a bit stuck on your own idea's and interpretations and overriding what we decide as a group in that
- Make sure to keep up with the tasks you've been assigned, including giving others feedback
